Installation Directions:

Flutter:
- Follow instructions on flutter installation website: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos

    - If you have M1, M2, etc. (silicon) chip, click on the Apple Silicon Installation. Otherwise click on the intel installation.
    - Once you get to the 'Run Flutter Doctor' step, let me know what issues the command prompt shows you and we will move on from there.
    - In case any 'flutter' commands do not work for you, make sure to follow the instructions in this step as well: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#update-your-path. 
    - We will primarily work off iOS because our client uses an iphone, so do most of their peers, and we are all developing on an iOS environment. This means that we have to make sure xCode and all relevant dependencies are working the way they are supposed to. As such, I highly recommend trying to follow the steps here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup
    - Finish all the steps on that previous link up until (not including) 'Deploy to physical iOS Devices'
    - From there we can run the base flutter app through visual studio code


Node.js:
- Follow instructions on https://nodejs.org/en/download

    - Make sure to install the LTS macOS installer
    - As you are going through the installation make sure to take a screenshot of the very last screen of the installer. We need the file path and version it specified in order to make sure we are all on the same version.


MongoDB:
- coming soon...
